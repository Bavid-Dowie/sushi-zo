        <p>Sushi Zo is created "Ittai-ken"-style. Ittai-jan is when the neta and shari unite in perfect harmony. The balance between the neta (the seafood) and shari (sushi rice) is the most important aspect of sushi.</p>
        <p>Our rice is meticulously cooked, seasoned with a unique blend of vinegars and served at body temperature, to create the perfect partner to the "neta".</p>
        <p>With many of our sushi selections, we use perfectly matched accompaniment for the particular "neta", which may include our unique soy sauce, sea, salt and other ingredients.</p>
